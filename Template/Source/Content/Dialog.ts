                T0003_1: "That means your life has somehow come to an end... but your soul is still trapped between life and death.",
                T0003_2: "In order to get you to the other side, you have to let go of your life. Otherwise, you will be trapped in this room forever.",
                T0003_3: "Only you can make that decision.",
                T0004: "It's not that easy, I...",
                T0005: "Okay okay, just let me think for a short moment...",
                T0006: "Oh, there might actually be a small chance of this working.",
                T0007_1: "You probably heard about the myth, that you see your life flashing by when you're dying...",
                T0007_2: "...well, it's kind of true.",
                T0008: "Here in the afterlife, we can revisit our dearest memories. Watching our lives passing by from a distance. Seeing those memories can help us to find closure and get ready to let go of everything.",
                T0009: "Sometimes though we regret certain decisions we made in the past. Here you could also make different desicions to see what would have happened instead. Just like in a simulation.",
                T0010: " It would help you a lot actually! If I transfer you back in your memories, you could relive everything and find out what brought you here.",
                T0011: "If we find the mistake, you don't need to stay here any longer and I will bring you back to life.",
                T0012: "Yeah, ironically memory loss is one of the side effects of being in the afterlife.",
                T0013: "That's why you don't get to choose the memories to relive.",
                T0014_1: "Remember? I am you.",
                T0014_2: "I know you. Your wishes, your dreams, your desires... That's why I am here with you. You just have to trust me.",
                T0015: "Alright, as soon as you are in the memory, you can't communicate with me anymore. Just live your life like you would usually do.",
                T0016: "As soon as we find the mistake, I will bring you back to me.",
                T0017: "See you soon!"
